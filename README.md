## Binder Badge to start the Binder environment:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GharbiRaouf/K_Means_Clustering/master)

## How to perform the exercise?
Click on the Launch Binder button, then a Binder window will open. A docker container with all necessary images will be created automatically. After a successful creation, a Jupyter window will be opened. Open K_Means_Clustering_Projekt.ipynb and then click on Run All at the top of Cell.

## Expected results ?
For this project we will try to use K Means clustering to divide universities in the USA into two groups: Private and public.

1. Reading data from College_Data.csv
2. Generate some visualizations for a general overview.
3. Explorative data analysis of College_Data.csv data with different graphic views.
4. Data preparation.
5. Creating of K Means clusters.
6. Evaluation of the data.
